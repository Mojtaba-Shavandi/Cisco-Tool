# Cisco Bulk Configuration Tool  

This tool is designed to **automate the deployment of initial or common configurations** across multiple Cisco switches or routers within an organization.  

## **Why Use This Tool?**  

Network administrators typically have two options when configuring multiple devices:  

1. **Manual Configuration** â€“ Setting up each device individually, which is time-consuming and increases the risk of human error.  
2. **Automated Deployment (Using This Tool)** â€“ Write the configuration once and apply it **simultaneously** to all target devices.  

## **Key Benefits**  

âœ… **Time-Saving** â€“ No need to configure each device manually.  
âœ… **Error Reduction** â€“ Minimizes the risk of misconfigurations.  
âœ… **Consistency** â€“ Ensures uniform configurations across all network devices.  

## **How It Works**  

1. Prepare the configuration file.  
2. Define the list of Cisco devices to be configured.  
3. Run the script â€“ it will automatically connect to each device and apply the configuration.  

This tool simplifies large-scale network configuration, making it more efficient and reliable for IT teams. ðŸš€

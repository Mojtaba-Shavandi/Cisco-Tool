# Cisco-Tool
This tool was developed to streamline the process of uploading an initial or common configuration to multiple Cisco switches or routers within an organization. Typically, network administrators face two choices: either configure each device manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, or use this script to write the configuration once, and automatically apply it to all devices at once. By automating this process, the script saves time, reduces human error, and ensures consistency across all network devices.
